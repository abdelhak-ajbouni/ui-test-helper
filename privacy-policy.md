# Privacy Policy for UI Test Helper Chrome Extension

**Last updated: August 10, 2025**

## Introduction

UI Test Helper ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how our Chrome extension handles user information.

## Data Collection

**We do not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.**

Specifically:
- ✅ **No user data collection**: We do not collect any personal information, browsing history, or user behavior data
- ✅ **No data transmission**: All processing happens locally in your browser - nothing is sent to external servers
- ✅ **No data storage**: We do not store any information about you or your usage patterns
- ✅ **No tracking**: We do not use analytics, tracking pixels, or any monitoring tools

## How the Extension Works

UI Test Helper operates entirely within your browser:

1. **Local Processing**: All functionality runs locally in your browser tabs
2. **Temporary Access**: Only accesses the active tab when you explicitly activate the extension
3. **No Data Retention**: Does not save or remember anything between sessions
4. **Clipboard Access**: Only writes generated test queries to your clipboard when you click "Copy" - we cannot read your clipboard contents

## Permissions Explained

Our extension requests these permissions:

- **`activeTab`**: Allows the extension to interact with the currently active tab only when you activate it (click the extension icon or use the keyboard shortcut)
- **`scripting`**: Enables injecting the inspection functionality into web pages to highlight elements and generate test queries

These permissions are the minimum required for our functionality and follow Chrome's principle of least privilege.

## Third-Party Services

We do not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or external APIs.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in this document with an updated "Last updated" date.

## Contact

If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please:
- Report issues on our GitHub repository
- Contact us through the Chrome Web Store

## Compliance

This extension complies with:
- Chrome Web Store policies
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
- Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)

**Summary: UI Test Helper is a privacy-first extension that processes everything locally and never collects or transmits your data.**
